# Properties

These are SFO Museum properties to append (or update) to Who's On First (WOF) documents.

These files are created and merged with source WOF documents using the `ensure-properties` and `merge-properties` tools, respectively, which are provided by the [go-sfomuseum-data-whosonfirst](https://github.com/sfomuseum/go-sfomuseum-data-whosonfirst) package.
